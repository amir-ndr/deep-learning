Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun and interesting optimization techniques in deep learning. It merges two images,
namely: a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G).
The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.
Neural Style Transfer uses a previously trained convolutional network (VGG-19), and builds on top of that (transfer learning).
you can see the output images in "out" folder.
