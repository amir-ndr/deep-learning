The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats and the test archive contains 12500.
we wrote a deep learning algorithm to classify cat/dog in traning and test sets.
after creatning the model, we compiled it with adam optimization and binary_crossentropy loss function, then we fit the model during 20 epochs and the batch_size was 128.
at the end we got 96% accuracy on training dataset and 95% accuracy on the test set.
