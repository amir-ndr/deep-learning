<h1> Context</h1><br />
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers.<br />
To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample, pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC.<br />
As a result, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact regions of IDC inside of a whole mount slide.<br /><br />

<h1> Content</h1><br />
The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x.<br />
From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive).<br />
Each patch’s file name is of the format: uxXyYclassC.png — > example 10253idx5x1351y1101class0.png .<br />
Where u is the patient ID (10253idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.<br /><br />

after creating the datasets and preprocessing the images, we create a CNN model and compile it with adam optimizer, then fitted it during 27 epochs with batch_size=128. at the end we got 90% accuracy on the validation set. you can also see the other evaluation in the jupyter notebook.

## Problem <a name="1"></a>

Breast cancer is a common form of cancer, and early detection is crucial. This project tackles the task of identifying cancerous regions in breast tissue images, which is a crucial step in cancer diagnosis.

## Preparing the Dataset <a name="2"></a>

The dataset consists of breast tissue images, categorized into healthy and cancerous classes. The images are preprocessed and organized for training and evaluation.

## Dataset Information <a name="3"></a>

The dataset contains two classes: healthy and cancerous. It's balanced and suitable for training a machine learning model. 

## Examples <a name="4"></a>

Sample images from the dataset are displayed to provide insights into the data.

## Data Generators <a name="5"></a>

Data generators are created to efficiently load and preprocess images for model training. This helps manage large datasets.

## Model <a name="6"></a>

### Designing the Model <a name="6.1"></a>

A CNN architecture is designed to classify breast tissue images. It includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers.

### Compiling the Model <a name="6.2"></a>

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

### Callbacks <a name="6.3"></a>

Callbacks like model checkpointing and early stopping are used to monitor and save the best model during training.

### Training the Model <a name="6.4"></a>

The model is trained on the dataset for multiple epochs to achieve optimal performance.

## Evaluation <a name="7"></a>

The model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset, and predictions are generated. The project also provides insights into the model's accuracy and visualizations of its predictions.
